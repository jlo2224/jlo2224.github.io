This game is a standard Texas Holdem poker game written with Java. Certain images, specifically the spade, heart, diamond, club, card back, empty card front, buttons, and chips were taken from the world wide web, and others such as the colored numbers/letters, green background, and text came from the Java JFrame library.

```cpp
byte ADCRead(byte ch)
{
    word value;
    ADC1SC1 = ch;
    while (ADC1SC1_COCO != 1)
    {   // wait until ADC conversion is completed   
    }
    return ADC1RL;  // lower 8-bit value out of 10-bit data from the ADC
}
```
