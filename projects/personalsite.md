During November of 2022, I developed a site to practice my skills using HTML and CSS. Prior to this, I have had light experience working with HTML, CSS, Flask, etc. during my time taking the CS50 course offered by Harvard, while writing a "Finance" page. Unlike the page and source code used in that class, however, this project was done entirely on my own (with the exception of some of the images). Note that despite the site being my own, one of the projects listed (specifically the super mario game) was done with source code.

### Inspiration

I remember first going on to sece.hawaii.edu to search for job openings, to see if I could get any job experience with computer science. Somehow, I ended up looking through other students' professional profiles, to use as inspiration to see how to improve on my own professional portfolio. I looked at someone's github.io page, and clicked on the link. In retrospect, that exact github.io page was probably developed in ICS314 and what I would be able to easily replicate just a couple of months after, but at the time, I was incredibly impressed by what I saw. I knew that I had to make my own personal site to impress employers.

So that's how I made my first site displaying my past projects. It's nothing too impressive, but it's not the kind of thing you can make in just a couple of hours, either. Despite that it has pretty good style, I didn't use any bootstrap or anything, just raw html and CSS. At this point in time, I've taken down the website, mostly because it costs $9.99 per month to host the website (crazy, right?) and also because I haven't really even submitted the URL to many employers. But I suppose a larger reason would be that this site that you view at this moment is probably more impressive than what I had before.
