During November of 2022, I developed a site to practice my skills using HTML and CSS. Prior to this, I have had light experience working with HTML, CSS, Flask, etc. during my time taking the CS50 course offered by Harvard, while writing a "Finance" page. Unlike the page and source code used in that class, however, this project was done entirely on my own (with the exception of some of the images). Note that despite the site being my own, one of the projects listed (specifically the super mario game) was done with source code.

### Inspiration

Out of boredom, and with too much time on my hands, I decided I should write my own game as a side project. ICS211 was a course I took in the Fall of 2022, and it was my first experience with Java. Naturally, to improve on my Java skills, I'd decided to write my own Poker game using Eclipse IDE.

I started out by writing a game via the command line, implementing Draw Poker. Thankfully, it worked perfectly, but it took me a painstaking amount of time, especially in cases like dealing with split pots and removing eliminated players from the table. After a week or so, I had my working game on the command-line, which surprisingly took as many as 600 lines of code, even with me following good code practice and optimizing it as much as possible.

I didn't anticipate that writing the code for the project shown above would take me so much longer, though. I reused some of the code, roughly 300 lines, and wrote a whopping 1700 more lines of code to implement the game. I had to do much self-research on how to use JFrame libraries to render a second screen, along with numerous images, but nonetheless, I got it to work. It took me around a month and a half, but I was quite proud of what I achieved. Since the game changed from Draw Poker to Texas Holdem, I had to change a lot of rules and functionality, and I had to figure out how to distinguish bots from players, and this was overall incredibly challenging. Moreover, dealing with bugs was a pain in the butt. 

I'm glad I got this experience, though. It's definitely a good project that I'll store somewhere safe in my laptop.
