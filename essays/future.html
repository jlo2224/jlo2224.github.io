<p><em>Decent professional portfolio? Check.
Understanding of javascript and general purpose languages? Check.
Several past projects to show off? Check.</em></p>

<h2 id="so-what-now">So what now?</h2>

<p>Well, in the past, I developed my computer science skills in high school through a radio telescope project, and by working on making my own games. So it would seem natural if I set my sights on doing more data visualization, research, and game development. But strangely, I feel now as if I want to drift away from those areas of computer science and pursue different passions.</p>

<p>Part of my goal is that in the future, I hope to improve in my ability to develop more sophisticated softwares for public use. After developing my professional portfolio with the aid of a template, I personally feel that I have the potential to make something much better.</p>

<p>For the time being, I am not completely sure of what future projects I want to strive for. Although I certainly do enjoy creating games, something in that general direction seems like just a temporary enjoyment to give myself some delight, rather than a long-term career goal. Other alternatives are team projects that I’ve been working on, in particular, developing software for clubs under ACM to use, or for a cuberover side project.</p>

<h2 id="yeah-we-get-it-youre-so-uncertain-so-boring-is-there-anything-you-want-to-do">Yeah, we get it, you’re so uncertain. SO boring. Is there anything you want to do?</h2>

<p>Although I have not fully set my sights on anything in particular, I would like to explore more about the computer’s ability to comprehend data, and artificial intelligence. Right now, I am completely confused on how any of this AI stuff works, but its absurd to think how far it has come in that something as advanced as ChatGPT became possible. I did have plenty of interest in artificial intelligence prior, (in particular machine learning) thinking that someday I’d be able to have my computer do my homework for me. Now that ChatGPT is a thing, it basically is reality, except we aren’t really allowed to use ChatGPT on any homeworks for any class. Nonetheless, diving deeper into Machine Learning is fascinating to me. I may go into robotics some day, and I’d love to see robots adapt to their environments and move around freely without user control.</p>

<p>But cybersecurity and cyber operations is definitely another general area of interest for me. I’m not exactly sure what it entails, but I do want to learn how to secure my computer and hack into other computers. Computer security will always crucial, so unlike specific research-based computer science topics, this topic will always be relevant.</p>

<h2 id="well-lets-not-get-ahead-of-ourselves">Well, let’s not get ahead of ourselves.</h2>

<p>Of course, these two interests are closer to lofty end goals rather than short-term goals. That being said, I have to start from somewhere, with a small step. So here are two more reasonable goals that can be achieved this semester, that is, two SMART goals:</p>

<p>1) Familiarize with a variety of OS. Currently, I have good familiarity with macOS, but I am aware that many workplaces require skills in other operating systems such as Ubuntu, Linux, and ROS. A team project I am working on is requiring that I gain more familiarity with ROS, so I definitely think that this is something I can work towards in the immediate future.
2) Learn how to write scripts. I’ve done some bash scripting in the past, but that’s about it. I know some scripting languages such as C# and javascript, but I really need to do better here. It would be difficult to create a concrete measurement to define the point in which I’ve “achieved” this goal, but nonetheless, this is something to strive for.</p>

<p>Who knows where the future will take me, though.</p>
