### Quick Recap

In this semester’s ICS 314, Software Engineering course, I’ve gained experience in numerous areas including enforcing coding standards, practicing agile project management, and using user interface frameworks. 
Furthermore, we’ve spent plenty of time practicing these skills for web development, and although web development is a major component of software engineering, there are topics in software engineering that are outside of the scope of web development. Nonetheless, some of the practices we’ve used in web development carry over to other aspects of software engineering.
### Agile Project Management

Agile project management is about breaking down a large project into smaller chunks called “sprints,” with successive sprints building off the last. For our team, we practiced issue-driven development specifically, in which we set up project boards and listed a large number of “issues” to be taken care of, and their progress is constantly public.
