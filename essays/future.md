Decent professional portfolio? Check. 
Understanding of javascript and general purpose languages? Check.
Several past projects to show off? Check.

##So what now?##

In the future, I hope to improve in my ability to develop more sophisticated softwares for public use. After developing my professional portfolio with the aid of a template, I personally feel that I have the potential to make something much better. 

For the time being, I'm unsure of what future projects I want to strive for. I certainly do enjoy creating games, so perhaps something in that general direction. Other alternatives are team projects that I've been working on, in particular, developing software for clubs under ACM to use, or for a cuberover side project.

I would like to learn more about the computer's ability to comprehend data, and artificial intelligence. Right now, I am completely confused on how any of this AI stuff works, but its absurd to think how far it has come in that something as advanced as ChatGPT became possible.
